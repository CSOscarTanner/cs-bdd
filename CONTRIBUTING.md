# Contributing

## Fork

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/concretesolutions/sunomono/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

## Pull request

1. Include the purpose of this Pull Request on the description. For example:

```
This is a spike to explore…

This simplifies the display of…

This fixes handling of…
```
2. Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place
3. Be explicit about when you want feedback, if the Pull Request is work in progress, say so. A prefix of “[WIP]” in the title is a simple, common pattern to indicate that state.


## Best pratices

1. Don't use tabs indentation
2. Don't exceed 80 characters in line
3. Write tests for new features
